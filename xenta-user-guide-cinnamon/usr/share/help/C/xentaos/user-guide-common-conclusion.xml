		There's a lot more to learn about Xenta OS and about Linux in general. This guide was just an overview of some of the aspects related to your desktop. By now you should feel more comfortable with using it and you should have a better understanding of some of its components. Where are you going to go next? Will you learn how to use the terminal? Will you give other desktops a try? It's entirely up to you. Remember, Linux is about fun and the community is there to help. Take your time and learn a little bit every day. There's always something new no matter how much you know already.
