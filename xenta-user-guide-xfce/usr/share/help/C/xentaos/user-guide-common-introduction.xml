	<title>Introduction to Xenta OS</title>
	 <para>
		Xenta OS is a computer operating system designed to work on most modern systems, including typical x86 and x64 PCs.
	</para>
	 <para>
		Xenta OS can be thought of as filling the same role as Microsoft's Windows, Apple's Mac OS, and the free BSD OS. Xenta OS is also designed to work in conjunction with other operating systems (including those listed above), and can automatically set up a <wordasword>dual boot</wordasword> or <wordasword>multi-boot</wordasword> environment (where the user is prompted as to which operating system to start at each boot-up) during its installation.
	</para>
	 <para>
		Xenta OS is a great operating system for individuals and for companies.
	</para>
	 <sect1 id="history"> <title>History</title>
	 <para>
		Xenta OS is a very modern operating system; Its development started in 2016. It is, however, built upon very mature and proven software layers, including the Linux kernel, the GNU tools and the &EDITION; desktop. It also relies on the Ubuntu and Debian projects and uses their systems as a base.
	</para>
	 <para>
		The Xenta OS project focuses on making the desktop more usable and more efficient for everyday tasks performed by regular users. Underneath the desktop the operating system also provides a huge collection of available software and a very well integrated set of services.
	</para>
	 <para>
		Xenta OS saw a rapid rise in popularity and more and more people use it every day.
	</para>
	 </sect1> <sect1> <title>Purpose</title>
	 <para>
		The purpose of Xenta OS is to provide a desktop operating system that home users and companies can use at no cost and which is as efficient, easy to use, and elegant as possible.
	</para>
	 <para>
		One of the ambitions of the Xenta OS project is to become the best operating system available by making it easy for people to get to use advanced technologies, rather than by simplifying them (and thereby reducing their capabilities), or by copying the approaches taken by other developers.
	</para>
	 <para>
		The goal is to develop our own idea of the ideal desktop. We think that it is best to make the most out of the modern technologies that exist under Linux and make it easy for everybody to use its most advanced features.
	</para>
	 </sect1> <sect1> <title>Version numbers and codenames</title>
	 <para>
		Version numbers and codenames follow a unique logic in Xenta OS:
	</para>
	 <itemizedlist>
		<listitem>
			<para>
				Codenames provide a way to refer to versions of Xenta OS that is more familiar than using a version number.
			</para>
		</listitem>
		 <listitem>
			<para>
				Since version 5, Xenta OS has followed a 6 months release cycle and uses a simplified version scheme. The version number simply gets incremented every 6 months.
			</para>
		</listitem>
		 <listitem>
			<para>
				If revisions are made to a particular release (a bit like Service Packs in Windows) its version number gets a minor revision increment. For instance <wordasword>3</wordasword> becomes <wordasword>3.1</wordasword>.
			</para>
		</listitem>
		 <listitem>
			<para>
				Codenames in Xenta OS are always female names ending with <wordasword>a</wordasword>. They follow the alphabetical order and the first letter of the codename corresponds to the index of the version number in the alphabet.
			</para>
		</listitem>

	</itemizedlist>
	 <para>
		So far Xenta OS has used the following codenames:

	</para>
	 <para>
		Xenta OS uses Linux Mint<footnote>
		<para>
			Linux Mint is another operating system based on GNU/Linux.
		</para>
		</footnote> repositories<footnote>
		<para>
			A repository is an online service by which software is stored and made available for the operating system to install and update from. Most operating systems based on GNU/Linux use repositories and connect to them via HTTP or FTP to install and upgrade their software.
		</para>
		</footnote> (more on what this means later) and is fully compatible with it so most of the resources, articles, tutorials, and software made for Linux Mint also work for Xenta OS. If you can’t find help on a specific subject, make sure to search on the same subject for Linux Mint.
