	<title>Installation of Xenta OS</title>
	 <para>
		You can download the Xenta OS operating system for free. It comes as an ISO file which you need to burn to a blank DVD<footnote>
		<para>
			It is also possible to write the ISO image to a USB stick or other memory device and boot from that, or to boot from the ISO image on the hard drive, but these options are somewhat more advanced and the method presented here is recommended. For help with alternative methods of installing and running Xenta OS, please visit the forums.
		</para>
		</footnote>. The liveDVD is then bootable and provides a fully-functional operating system which you can try without affecting your PC. In layman's terms, when you put Xenta OS on a DVD and place it into your computer, you can try it out while leaving your current system intact.
	</para>
	 <para>
		If you like what you see when running the liveDVD you can decide to install the system to your hard drive. All the necessary tools (partitioning and installation tools) are present on the DVD.
	</para>
	 <sect1 id="download-iso"> <title>Download the ISO</title>
	 <para>
		To download Xenta OS, visit the download page at <ulink url="http://www.xentaos.org/p/download.html">http://www.xentaos.org/p/download.html</ulink> and choose the edition you're interested in.
	</para>
	 <para>
		From this page, you should find:
	</para>
	 <itemizedlist>

	 <para>
		The file you need to download is an ISO file. There are two ways to download this file, by torrent (a Peer to Peer protocol) or via a download mirror (HTTP or FTP protocol). Once your download is finished, you can ensure your ISO file isn’t corrupted by checking its signature with the MD5.
	</para>
	 <note>
		<para>
			If you don't have a broadband connection, or if your Internet access is too slow you can order the DVD from <ulink url="http://www.xentaos.org/p/store.html">http://www.xentaos.org/p/store.html</ulink>.
		</para>
	</note>
	 <sect2> <title>Via torrent</title>
	 <para>
		Torrent is a Peer to Peer (P2P) protocol. Basically, instead of downloading from a central location, a torrent lets you download the ISO file in parts from different people across the Internet.
	</para>
	 <para>
		The more people who download the ISO file, the faster the download speed gets. This is the preferred and recommended way to download Xenta OS.
	</para>
	 <sect3> <title>Install a Torrent client</title>
	 <para>
		You need a piece of software called a "torrent client" in order to download files via torrent.
	</para>
	 <itemizedlist>
		<listitem>
			<para>
				If you run Xenta OS you already have a torrent client installed.
			</para>
		</listitem>
		 <listitem>
			<para>
				If you run another Linux distribution, you can install "Transmission".
			</para>
		</listitem>
		 <listitem>
			<para>
				If you run Windows you can use µTorrent.
			</para>
		</listitem>

	</itemizedlist>
	 </sect3> <sect3> <title>Download the Torrent file</title>
	 <para>
		The next step is to follow the torrent link from the Xenta OS website and to download the .torrent file. This file is very small. After it downloads, you should open it with your torrent client.
	</para>
	 <para>
		The torrent client will probably ask you where you want to save the ISO. Select a destination and then wait for the download to complete.
	</para>
	 <para>
		For more information about the torrent protocol, visit <ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent</ulink>.
	</para>
	 </sect3> </sect2> <sect2> <title>Via direct download</title>
	 <para>
		If you can’t, or do not choose to use the torrent protocol, then look at the list of download mirrors and pick one of them. They’ll provide a link to the ISO file itself which you can just click to start the download.
	</para>
	 </sect2> </sect1> <sect1> <title>Read the release notes</title>
	 <para>
		Your download is probably going to last at least an hour, so now would be the perfect time for you to get familiar with the new features coming with the release you’re currently downloading.
	</para>
	 <para>
		The release notes are featured on the Xenta OS web page and answer the following questions:
	</para>
	 <itemizedlist>
		<listitem>
			<para>
				What are the new features delivered in this release?
			</para>
		</listitem>
		 <listitem>
			<para>
				What are the known problems of this release?
			</para>
		</listitem>
		 <listitem>
			<para>
				How do I upgrade from the previous release?
			</para>
		</listitem>

	</itemizedlist>
	 <para>
		They also contain screenshots of the latest release. Of course, you could find out about most features highlighted in the release notes by simply using the operating system, but you might miss a few things, so it is most reliable to read the release notes.
	</para>
	 <para>
		The release notes for Xenta OS 1.3 LTS Arok are available at <ulink url="http://www.xentaos.org/2017/08/rilis-xenta-os-13-lts-arok-cinnamon.html">http://www.xentaos.org/2017/08/rilis-xenta-os-13-lts-arok-cinnamon.html</ulink>
	</para>
	 </sect1> <sect1> <title>Check the MD5</title>
	 <para>
		You’ve read the release notes, you just can’t wait to play with the new features or try Xenta OS, and your download just finished successfully. You’re ready to burn a DVD and to boot on it… but hey! Wait for a second!
	</para>
	 <para>
		If that DVD is faulty you will experience weird bugs and will have a lot of trouble finding help. The two most common reasons for a DVD to be faulty are:
	</para>
	 <itemizedlist>
		<listitem>
			<para>
				An issue with the download causing problems in your ISO file
			</para>
		</listitem>
		 <listitem>
			<para>
				An error during the burn process that alters the contents of your burned liveDVD
			</para>
		</listitem>

	</itemizedlist>
	 <para>
		The MD5 signature, which is present on the download page, provides a quick way for you to make sure that your ISO file is exactly like it should be. So, let’s check the ISO file you just downloaded before we burn it and save ourselves from a lot of potential problems.
	</para>
	 <para>
		If you run any version of Linux you probably already have the md5sum program installed. Open a terminal and “cd” to the directory where your ISO file is (for instance, if “linuxmint.iso” is on the Desktop), open a terminal and type:
	</para>
	 
<screen>
                <command>cd ~/Desktop</command>
                <command>md5sum <replaceable>myfile.iso</replaceable></command>
</screen>
	 <para>
		This command should output a series of numbers and letters which comprise the MD5 sum, or signature, of your ISO file. By design, any small change to the ISO file will cause this signature to be significantly different, allowing us to verify that the file is exactly as it should be.
	</para>
	 <para>
		Compare that signature with the one on the download page of the Xenta OS website. If the two signatures are the same, then you know your ISO file is exactly the same as the original and you can now get ready to burn it on DVD.
	</para>
	 <note>
		<para>
			If you happen to run Windows, chances are you don’t have md5sum installed. You can get it from here: <ulink url="http://www.etree.org/md5com.html">http://www.etree.org/md5com.html</ulink>
		</para>
		 <para>
			Place the ISO file and the md5sum.exe in the same place (let’s say in C:\) and run “cmd.exe”. In the command line environment, type the following commands:
		</para>
		 
<screen>
                <command>C:</command>
                <command>cd \</command>
                <command>md5sum <replaceable>myfile.iso</replaceable></command>
</screen>
		 <para>
			Then compare the signature to the one present on the website.
		</para>

	</note>
	 </sect1> <sect1> <title>Burn the ISO to DVD</title>
	 <para>
		Now that you have checked the ISO file with MD5, you are ready to burn it to a DVD.
	</para>
	 <para>
		Get a blank DVD-R (a DVD-RW should work as well, but this type of media is known to have compatibility issues) and your favorite marker and label the DVD. Although labeling your DVDs sounds trivial, you should be sure to do so, as you can easily end up with 20 unlabeled and unidentifiable discs on your desk. :)
	</para>
	 <para>
		Insert the blank DVD-R in the drive and get ready to burn the ISO.
	</para>
	 <para>
		If you’re running Linux with Cinnamon right-click on the ISO file and select: open with: Brasero, choose “Burn image” and follow the steps given there.
	</para>
	 <para>
		If you’re running Linux with KDE, launch K3B and in the “Tools” menu choose “Write ISO Image”.
	</para>
	 <para>
		If you’re running Windows you can use a program like InfraRecorder.
	</para>
	 <note>
		<para>
			Make sure to burn the ISO image to disk, and not to write the ISO file to the disk. A very common mistake, especially for people using Nero, is to actually burn the ISO file on the disk as a data file. The ISO file is an image of a disk so it needs to be burnt not as a file which will appear on the disk, but as an ISO image which will be decompressed and whose content will be burnt onto the disc. After burning the DVD you shouldn't see the ISO file within the disc, but rather folders like “casper” or “isolinux”. Most burning software has a special option for this.
		</para>
	</note>
	 </sect1> <sect1> <title>Boot the LiveDVD</title>
	 <para>
		Place the DVD in the drive and restart the computer. You should now see the following screen:

	</figure>
	 <note>
		<para>
			If you don’t see this screen and your PC boots as usual it’s probably because your BIOS is not set to boot on DVD. Restart the computer and press F1, F2, Delete, or Escape (or whatever key lets you enter the BIOS configuration) and change your BIOS settings to tell your computer to boot from its DVD drive.
		</para>
	</note>
	 </sect1> <sect1> <title>Install Xenta OS on your hard drive</title>
	 <para>
		From the first screen choose the default <guilabel>Start Xenta OS</guilabel> option and press Enter. After a little while the live system should be ready and you should see the desktop.
	</para>
	 <para>
		At this stage Xenta OS is not installed on your computer, it’s simply running from the DVD. The system you have in front of you is, however, almost exactly the same as the one you will have on your computer after the installation is finished.
	</para>
	 <para>
		Have fun with it and see if you like it. Bear in mind that when running from the DVD, Xenta OS runs significantly slower than it does when it is installed on a hard drive, since it has to read data from the DVD drive, which is a slower medium than the hard drive.
	</para>
	 <para>
		When you are ready, double-click on the <guilabel>Install Xenta OS</guilabel> icon located on the desktop. The Installer appears:

		If you haven’t read the release notes yet, and you have an Internet connection, then this an ideal opportunity to review them; simply click on the underlined link. It is highly recommended that users read the release notes prior to installation in order to advise themselves of new features, as well as any issues that might affect their particular hardware configuration.

		 <listitem>
			<para>
				If you choose to install it alongside other operating systems, the installer will use the free space available on other partitions to create a new one for Xenta OS. You will be asked how much space you want to allocate to it. The installer will then shrink a partition and take care of everything for you. Post-installation your computer will have a boot screen from which you'll be able to boot all your operating systems.
			</para>
		</listitem>
		 <listitem>
			<para>
				If you choose to specify partitions manually, a partition editor will appear, giving you full control over the partitioning of your hard drive. This is recommended only to advanced users who understand how partitioning works under Linux. Note that Xenta OS requires a partition of at least 6GB and that the recommended size for a swap partition is 1.5 times the amount of RAM available on the computer.

	</para>
	 <note>
		<para>
			Sometimes the installer doesn't properly handle Summer/Winter time adjustments, so even by selecting the proper city you might see a difference of an hour or so with the correct time. Simply ignore this at this stage and remember to make sure that the time is correct after you reboot in your newly installed Xenta OS desktop.

	</para>
	 <para>
		Also give your computer a name. This name will be used by your computer on the network or in various places of the system. If you’ve never really thought about naming your computers, then now is the time. People commonly pick flower (dahlia, rose, tulip) or planet (mars, jupiter, pluto) names for the computers on their network. It’s entirely up to you what you want to use, but make sure to pick a name you like and that you will easily remember.
