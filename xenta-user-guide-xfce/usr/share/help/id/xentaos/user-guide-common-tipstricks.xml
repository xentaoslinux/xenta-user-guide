	 <para>
		Apakah Anda mencoba memaksimalkan desktop Anda? Apakah Anda biasanya menekan <keycombo><keycap>Ctrl</keycap><keycap>C</keycap></keycombo> pada keyboard Anda untuk menyalin beberapa teks? Apakah Anda membuka editor teks untuk membuat catatan cepat? Bagaimana Anda berbagi file dengan teman Anda? Ada banyak cara untuk melakukan tugas-tugas sederhana, beberapa lebih efisien daripada yang lain. Bab ini akan menunjukkan kepada Anda beberapa kekhasan dari desktop Xenta OS, untuk memastikan Anda memaksimalkan sistem Anda.

	 <para>
		Kebanyakan orang terbiasa mengklik menu <guimenu> Edit </guimenu> atau mengklik kanan pada konten yang ingin mereka salin. Di Xenta OS Anda dapat melakukan ini juga, tetapi Anda juga dapat menyalin dan menempel konten dari kenyamanan mouse Anda. Begini cara kerjanya: Tombol kiri dari salinan mouse dan tembel tombol tengah. Sesederhana itu!

		Let's give it a try. Launch LibreOffice Writer or a text editor, or any application of your choice that lets you input text. Now type a few sentences. Select some of the text you just typed with the left button of your mouse. Think you need to click on the <guimenu>Edit</guimenu> menu and press <guimenuitem>Copy</guimenuitem>? No? Bet you're thinking you would use a combination of keys on your keyboard such as <keycombo><keycap>Ctrl</keycap><keycap>C</keycap></keycombo>. In Linux, it is much simpler. Just by selecting the text, you've already copied it. That's right... that text is now copied to your mouse buffer and you don't need to press anything else.
	</para>
	 <para>
		Now click on some other part of the document to move the cursor there and click the middle button of your mouse (or the wheel-click if you have a mouse with a wheel). As you can see the text you previously selected has now been pasted.
	</para>
	 <para>
		The more you get used to this the faster you'll get at copying and pasting content.

			The buffer used by the mouse is not the same as the one used by the desktop. So you can actually copy something with your mouse and copy something else with <keycombo><keycap>Ctrl</keycap><keycap>C</keycap></keycombo> or with the <guimenu>Edit</guimenu> menu. Thanks to this you can copy two elements at a time and depending on how you copied them you can paste them with either the middle mouse button or with <keycombo><keycap>Ctrl</keycap><keycap>V</keycap></keycombo> or the <guimenu>Edit</guimenu> menu.

	 <para>
		We all take notes. Whether it's an address given by someone over the phone, an ever-growing TODO list or some particular thing to remember, we're often faced with the situation where we need to take a quick note. Some of us have a lot of written notes around our computers and never seem to find a working pen when the situation arises, others waste time in launching tools that are not suitable for this particular use (LibreOffice Writer for instance is not very handy to take notes) and very few people actually use software dedicated to note-taking. Xenta OS happens to include a dedicated note-taking tool. It is called Tomboy Notes.

		Tomboy Notes is a very easy tool to use. By clicking on it you get a list of all your notes. You can create new notes by clicking on <guibutton>Create New Note</guibutton>.
	</para>
	 <para>
		A new note opens up. By changing its title you'll also change its name. You can write whatever you want in the note and close it. The content you wrote in your note will always be accessible through Tomboy Notes; You don't need to save anything and you can even reboot or turn off the computer. Again, your note is saved automatically as you're writing it.
	</para>
	 <para>
		If you eventually decide that you no longer need to keep a particular note, you can open that note and click on the <guibutton>Delete</guibutton> button.
	</para>
	 <para>
		If you write down the name of another note's title within your note, Tomboy will automatically create a link to that other note and you'll be able to click that link to open the other note.
	</para>
	 <para>
		You can also use different formatting options within your note and use the many features provided by Tomboy Notes (synchronization, search features, export notes to PDF/HTML...etc).
